Our application asks a user to enter their favorite Jordan sneaker 
with their corresponding shoe size which you can add a Jordan shoe to your wish list
or you can delete a shoe from your wishlist. At our main page, we have a dad joke 
generate which spices our page up for some fun dad jokes! We have added the photos in an images folder
to be able to render them appropriately when using Express. To avoid making the project too large in size
the only shoes that can be added to the collection are image folder. Jordan 1's through Jordan 4's, in blue
or red. Except for the Jordan 2's which only have the red and green color. They follow the name convention of
jordan{number}{Color}. All other images are used for CSS purposes.

-Shoe color must start with a capital letter.
-When adding a shoe an image of the shoe being added is shown.
-When searching for a shoe, either a picture and a message confirming the owenership of the shoe is rendered.
-If the shoe is not a part of the collection a default picture will show and message explainging you don't 
own that particular shoe.
-Deleting the collection allows for ease of restarting the collection for testing purposes.
